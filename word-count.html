        Ask the user what's on their mind. Then after the user responds, count the number of words in the sentence and print that as an output.

        Example:

        Prompt: what's on your mind today?
        Input: well, it's just a day for me to be an expert in coding
        Output: oh nice, you just told me what's on your mind in 13 words! 
    -->
    <h1>Word Count</h1>
    <p></p>
    <script>
        let userInput = prompt("What is on your mind today?");
        console.log(userInput);
        
        let wordCount = userInput.split(" ").length;
        console.log(wordCount);

        let output = document.querySelector("p");

        output.innerHTML = "Oh nice, you just told me what's on your mind in " + wordCount + " words!"
